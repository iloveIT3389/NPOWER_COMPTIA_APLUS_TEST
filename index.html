        // Quiz Data - ALL 829 QUESTIONS
        const QUIZ_DATA = {"Chapter 6: Operating Systems": [{"id": 1, "question": "You want to transfer files from your computer to a remote server. To do this, you want to connect to a shared directory on the server and copy the files. Which command-line utility will allow you to do this?", "options": ["netstat", "net use", "netshare", "netdom"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "The net use command enables you to connect to a shared resource. Depending on the version of Windows you are using, net can be one of the most powerful commands at your disposal. While all Windows versions include a net command, its capabilities differ based on whether it is used on a server or workstation and the version of the operating system. Commonly, net share is used to create shared folders, and net use is used to connect to shared resources. The net user command allows administrators to create and manage user accounts. netstat shows what sockets (IP address plus port) are being used and by which protocols. Net Share is a valid command for managing shared resources, but netshare and netdom are not valid commands."}, {"id": 2, "question": "A technician is troubleshooting a computer that occasionally will not read data from the hard drive. What should they try first?", "options": ["Run Defragment and Optimize Drives.", "Run chkdsk /f at a command prompt.", "Format the hard drive and reinstall the OS.", "Replace the hard drive."], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "It’s possible that the hard drive has some bad sectors, so run chkdsk /f to scan the drive and attempt to repair them. If that doesn’t work, formatting is the second option, and replacing the drive is the third. If your drive is getting read/write errors, having an extra hard drive on hand would be wise."}, {"id": 3, "question": "You have replaced a failed hard drive and need to prepare the new drive for data storage. Which of the following utilities will you use first?", "options": ["format", "chkdsk", "diskpart", "gpupdate"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "The diskpart utility lets the user see and manage partitions on the computer’s hard drives. Because of the enormous power it holds, the user must have administrator status to run diskpart. Once a partition is created, the format command will set up the file system on the new volume. The chkdsk command verifies the disk integrity and gpupdate forces group policy changes to take effect immediately."}, {"id": 4, "question": "Which of the following file system types available in Windows Pro for Workstations will detect when data on a mirrored drive has been corrupted and will use a healthy copy of the data on other drives to attempt to correct corrupted data and protect data?", "options": ["NTFS", "ReFS", "ext4", "FAT32"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Resilient File System (ReFS) is a feature available on Windows Pro for Workstations and Windows Enterprise editions. ReFS will detect when data on a mirrored drive has been corrupted and will use a healthy copy of the data on other drives to attempt to correct corrupted data and protect data. New Technology File System (NTFS) has been available on Windows operating systems (OSs) since 1993 and provides file encryption and the ability to use NTFS permissions for security. The fourth extended filesystem (ext4) is a Linux filesys- tem, and File Allocation Table 32 (FAT32) is a legacy filesystem sometimes used for compat- ibility between different OSs, and used on external storage devices like memory cards, Universal Serial Bus (USB) drives, and hard drives."}, {"id": 5, "question": "You want to use BitLocker to encrypt the company president’s laptop drive, but when you go into the Control Panel to find it, it isn’t there. What Windows 10 edition does this computer have?", "options": ["Home", "Pro", "Pro for Workstations", "Enterprise"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "Windows 10 Home edition does not offer BitLocker as an option. BitLocker is available in the Pro, Pro for Workstations, and Enterprise editions."}, {"id": 6, "question": "Which of the following Windows editions support ReFS? (Choose two.)", "options": ["Home", "Pro", "Pro for Workstations", "Enterprise"], "correctAnswers": [2, 3], "explanation": "Resilient File System (ReFS) is a feature available on Windows Pro for Workstations and Windows Enterprise editions. ReFS will detect when data on a mirrored drive has been corrupted and will use a healthy copy of the data on other drives to attempt to correct corrupted data and protect data. As of the fall 2023 update, ReFS use on Pro editions of Windows became limited. To use the full-featured ReFS, you need Pro for Workstations or Enterprise editions.", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 7, "question": "You just purchased a new computer that has four CPUs. What edition of Windows will you need, at a minimum, to take advantage of the computer’s processing capability?", "options": ["Home", "Pro", "Pro for Workstations", "Enterprise"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "Windows Pro for Workstations is designed so that users can take advantage of the capabilities of high-end workstations. Windows Home edition can support up to two physical Central Processing Units (CPUs), while Windows Pro for Workstations can support up to four physical processors. Remember that each physical processor has multiple cores. 484     Appendix ▪ Answers to the Review Questions"}, {"id": 8, "question": "An employee wants to bring their Windows device to use at work. At work, they will need to log in to a domain. Which reason listed will prohibit the employee from using their device on the domain?", "options": ["Their device has only one processor.", "Their device OS is Windows Home.", "Their device has only 8 GB of RAM.", "Their device must be Windows Enterprise edition."], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Windows Home does not have the capability of joining a domain, so the employee will not be able to use their personal device. Windows Pro, Pro for Workstations, and Enterprise editions are all able to log in to a domain. The number of processors and amount of RAM are irrelevant to the ability to log in to a domain."}, {"id": 9, "question": "One of your technicians needs to use the Task Manager utility. What are two ways they can open Task Manager? (Choose two.)", "options": ["Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete and then click Task Manager", "Press Ctrl+Shift+T", "Press Ctrl+Alt+T", "Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc"], "correctAnswers": [0, 3], "explanation": "Task Manager is a powerful tool that works in all versions of Windows, although it has different capabilities in different versions. In Windows 10 and 11, it allows you to shut down nonresponsive applications and view the performance of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, disks, Wi-Fi, and Graphics Processing Units (GPUs); as well as to show application usage history, services, and programs launched at startup, users attached to the system, and other useful information.", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 10, "question": "You need to configure Internet connections on a Windows workstation. Which tabs of the Internet Options utility in the Control Panel would you use to set the Home page and enable the pop-up blocker?", "options": ["Connections, Security", "General, Security", "General, Privacy", "Connections, Privacy"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "The Internet Options utility in the Windows Control Panel has six tabs that allow you to configure how your browser interacts with the Internet. The six tabs are General, Security, Privacy, Content, Connections, Programs, and Advanced. (Note, not all versions of Windows have the Content tab.) The General tab allows you to change the Home page, while the Privacy tab has a Turn on Pop-up Blocker option."}, {"id": 11, "question": "A network connection doesn’t seem to be working as it should. You’ve verified that the cables are good from end to end. Where can you quickly look in the OS to see if there is a problem with the onboard NIC driver?", "options": ["Device Manager", "Programs and Features", "File Explorer Options", "Ease of Access"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "A quick look at Device Manager (devmgmt.msc) is often all you need to troubleshoot a problem with an onboard device. In Device Manager, if the device drivers aren’t installed for the device, you’ll see a yellow exclamation point next to the device name in the list, which signifies that the device is not working properly. Programs and Features enables the user to add, remove, or troubleshoot installed programs (the options will change by program) and add Windows features that are not yet installed. The File Explorer Options utility changes how File Explorer works, such as showing hidden files or extensions and other view options. Ease of Access provides alternative ways to interact with the computer for differently-abled users."}, {"id": 12, "question": "A salesperson in your company travels regularly to foreign countries through different time zones. They have asked you if there is a way to set their Windows 11 PC so that it will always show the time and date for their location. How can this be done? Set Time Automatically. Automatically.", "options": ["In Windows Settings, choose Time & language, then choose Date And Time, and select", "In the Control Panel, choose Date and Time, and then select Set Time Zone", "In Windows Settings, choose Date And Time, and then select Synchronize Your Clock.", "In Windows Settings, choose Time & language, then  choose Date And Time, and select"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "To always show the time and date correctly for the salesperson’s location, you would need to enable both Set time zone automatically and Set time automatically, as shown in the graphic. Sync now, which synchronizes your clock, would work in the moment but will not automatically change the time and time zone as the salesperson travels."}, {"id": 13, "question": "One of your Windows 10 users has limited eyesight and has asked you to enable voice activation for as many applications as possible. Where can this be done?", "options": ["In the Control Panel, Default Programs", "In Windows Settings, under Privacy, Notifications", "In Windows Settings, under Privacy, Voice Activation", "In the Control Panel, Indexing Options"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "The Voice activation window of Privacy settings in Windows Settings will allow the user to turn on microphone access and choose which apps are allowed to use voice activation, even when the device is locked. The choices are slightly different in Windows 11. In Windows Settings, choose Privacy & security, then Speech. The setting is on by default. The Default Programs app of the Control Panel allows you to manage default applications for opening types of files, such as photos or mail by opening those settings in Windows Settings. By choosing Privacy, then Notifications in the Windows Setting, you can allow or deny applica- tions to access your notifications. The Control Panel’s Indexing Options look at words in and metadata of files to provide faster file searches."}, {"id": 14, "question": "You are working with a customer that has a small workgroup (peer-to-peer) network. The employee computers have a program that requires using the X drive. Several computer users need to be able to access this drive, which is actually a shared folder located on the manager’s PC. What can you do to make this drive available for other computers to access as Drive X:\\? (Choose two.) PC), and then click Map Network Drive. Next to Drive:, choose X:, and then navigate to the shared resource. Map Network Drive. user account.", "options": ["On each client computer, open File Explorer, right-click on This PC (or the name of the", "On the manager’s PC, navigate to the shared folder, and then right-click on it and choose", "On the manager’s PC, ensure that each user who will connect to the manager’s PC has a", "On the client computer, create a folder called Drive X, and then, on the manager’s PC,"], "correctAnswers": [0, 2], "explanation": "In a workgroup (peer-to-peer) network, you would first need to ensure that each person who will be using the shared resource has a username and password on the manager’s computer. The resource would then be shared on the manager’s PC, and on each employee’s computer, go into File Explorer, click on This PC, then Map Network Drive and follow the onscreen prompts to map drive X:\\ to that shared resource. Chapter 6: Operating Systems     485", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 15, "question": "You are setting up a network for a very small company. It has a total of 10 computers running a mix of Windows 11 Home and Windows 11 Pro computers, and it has a network-attached printer. What will you use to allow the company to share files and its printer?", "options": ["Domain", "Workgroup", "Homegroup", "Crossover cables"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "To have a domain, you would need a Domain Controller (DC), for which the company would need Windows Server software installed on a network-connected computer. They only have Windows 10 workstations. Homegroups were a networking scheme that shared a computer’s libraries with other people on the same Homegroup, but Homegroups are no longer an option. Crossover cables are not a practical way to share anything among 10 computers. By default, the computers would belong to the workgroup named workgroup. Each computer that is sharing a resource would need to have the user they are sharing with listed on that computer, then the person sharing information could right-click a folder and choose Give access to, then Specific people, and choose with whom they want to share that particular resource. Workgroups are great for small groups of people, but if there are more than 20 or 30 people in the group, you’ll likely want to move up to a Domain Controller and centralized security."}, {"id": 16, "question": "A user’s Windows workstation seems to be using an excessive amount of memory. Which management tool could you use to identify the application that is causing the problem?", "options": ["Performance Monitor", "Computer Management", "Windows Memory Diagnostics", "Processes tab of Task Manager"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "One of Task Manager’s many capabilities is allowing you to see what resources (e.g., memory, Central Processing Unit [CPU], Graphics Processing Unit [GPU], network, and disk) are being used by application, and it allows you to end the process or the entire process tree to free up those resources. Performance Monitor will show resources used but not by application. Computer Management gives access to several other resources but not Task Manager, while Windows Memory Diagnostics is used to test the health of Random Access Memory (RAM) modules."}, {"id": 17, "question": "The CEO will be attending several meetings whose discussions must remain confidential. They want to ensure that the microphone on their Windows 11 PC is not available while they are using certain apps. Where can these settings be configured?", "options": ["In Windows Settings, choose Privacy & Security and then Microphone.", "Device Manager", "Computer Management", "In Windows Settings, choose Personalization."], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "In Windows 11 Settings, choosing Privacy & security, then Microphone opens a window that provides granular settings for microphone use, including which apps can use the microphone. Device Manager could be used to disable the microphone, but it would be for all purposes. Computer Management provides access to several tools, but not granular microphone settings. In Windows Settings, Personalization options allow the user to change settings, such as background, colors, and lock screen. In Windows 10, the only difference is that you would choose Privacy, not Privacy & security."}, {"id": 18, "question": "You are manually configuring IPv4 addresses on a computer. The IP address is 200.100. 1.10, and the network number is 200.100.0.0. What is the appropriate subnet mask for this computer?", "options": ["200.100.0.0", "255.255.0.0", "0.0.255.255", "192.168.0.0"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "The best way to understand IPv4 addressing is to convert the IP address and subnet mask to binary numbers. This is essentially what the operating system is looking at when deter- mining the network and host portion of an IP address. What we see as dotted decimal notation is seen by the computer as four sets of eight binary bits (either a 1 or a 0). In the subnet mask, a binary 1 indicates that the position of that bit is part of the network number, and a 0 indicates that it is part of the host number. Network numbers always go consecu- tively from left to right with no breaks between. Eight binary bits that are all ones (11111111) equates to 255 in decimal, so the maximum value of a subnet mask’s octet is"}, {"id": 19, "question": "You are configuring a Windows client computer on a network that has a DHCP server and a DNS server attached. From where will the computer get a dynamic IP address and subnet mask? Internet.", "options": ["You will manually configure them in Windows Settings by choosing Personalization.", "You will manually configure them in Windows Settings by choosing Network &", "It will automatically get them from the DHCP server.", "It will automatically get them from the DNS server."], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "The default setting for obtaining an IP address is automatic, which means that the computer will look for a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server to assign it 486     Appendix ▪ Answers to the Review Questions an IP address and subnet mask automatically. No manual configuration is required, but in Windows 11 if you open Windows Settings and click on Network & Internet, then click on Properties of the network connection you want to change, and then click Edit next to IP assignment, you can change the default settings to manual. The process is the same for IPv6, except that you would choose IPv6 instead of IPv4 once you’re on the Edit screen. This can also be done through the Control Panel, by clicking on Network and Sharing Center instead of Network & Internet, then clicking on Change adapter settings and right-clicking on the network connection you want to change. Choose properties, then click on IPv4 and click on configure. Your screen should be similar to the following figure."}, {"id": 20, "question": "You have been told to configure a static IP of 110.110.1.5 for a server. This server will need to be able to access the Internet. Which of the following is not a required setting to configure?", "options": ["Default gateway", "IP address", "Proxy server", "Subnet mask"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "An IP address on a device can either be dynamic or static. In a static IP address, the minimum amount of information that needs to be configured is the IP address, subnet mask, and, if the computer will access the Internet or other networks, a default gateway. A proxy server is an added security measure between a device and the Internet. It is used to translate between protocols and filter out certain types of traffic, such as keeping inappropri- ate websites out and confidential data in the network."}, {"id": 21, "question": "Considering the graphic, what is most likely the IP address of a router?", "options": ["192.168.1.242", "192.168.1.1", "CC-15-2A-CC-3B-31", "255.255.255.0"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Often on a network, especially a smaller one, the router will serve multiple purposes. In this scenario, it is the default gateway, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server, and the Domain Name System (DNS) server. 192.168.1.1 is the address of the router, gateway, DHCP server, and DNS server. 192.168.1.242 is the local computer’s IP address. CC-15-2A-CC-3B-31 is the Media Access Control (MAC) address, which is embed- ded in the computer’s network interface card (NIC). 255.255.255.0 is the subnet mask."}, {"id": 22, "question": "What security feature, common to iOS and iPad OS 16.4.1 or greater and macOS 13.3.1 or greater, automatically provides security updates that are installed on startup before the OS is even active?", "options": ["Sandbox", "File Quarantine", "RSR", "Antivirus"], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "Rapid Security Response (RSR) is a feature of new iOS, iPad OS, and macOS systems. It automatically sends targeted fixes for security issues between software updates. For example, if there’s a security update to Safari, it is loaded before the operating system (OS) on startup, or it may be deployed when the system is on, and sometimes will ask the user to restart Safari (but not always). Each RSR will update the OS number with a letter after, such as 16.4.1 (b). RSR is on by default but can be turned off in System Settings, General, Software updates, and Automatic updates (although that’s not advisable!). Sandbox and File Quarantine are part of macOS’s built-in antivirus protection that only requires you keep the system updated, which it will do automatically."}, {"id": 23, "question": "What is the purpose of a subnet mask?", "options": ["Identifies the network portion of an IPv4 address", "Identifies the network portion of an IPv6 address", "Masks (hides) part of the IP address from a hacker", "Masks (hides) the host number from a hacker"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "In IPv4 networking, a computer system will compare the subnet mask to the IP address to identify the network and host number of the IP address. IPv6 addresses don’t use a subnet mask. IPv6 addresses consist of eight segments. The first three are a site prefix, the fourth is the subnet ID, and the last four segments are the interface ID, which is essentially the host address. The subnet mask doesn’t hide anything."}, {"id": 24, "question": "You’ve been asked to help with a network for a company that has 50 computers. The company has been using workgroups, but they are getting too difficult to manage. There are an assortment of Windows 11 editions on the computers, including Home, Pro, and Enterprise. What will you do to set up the new network? (Choose two.)", "options": ["Upgrade all the Windows Home PCs to Windows Pro.", "Install a server with Active Directory.", "Downgrade all the Windows 11 Enterprise workstations to Windows 11 Pro.", "Upgrade all the workstations to Windows 11 Enterprise."], "correctAnswers": [0, 1], "explanation": "A network with that many computers (typically more than 10) needs a domain for security management. The Windows 11 Home edition PCs can’t log in to a domain, so they would need to be upgraded to at least the Pro edition. It’s not necessary to downgrade the Windows 11 Enterprise workstations to Windows 11 Pro or upgrade the workstations to Windows 11 Enterprise.", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 25, "question": "You work for a multinational corporation. All the company laptops are configured to use United States English; however, a worker who speaks Bajan (Barbados English) would prefer to see apps and websites in their native language. Is this possible?", "options": ["No, this is not possible.", "Yes. Add English (Barbados) in the Control Panel, Programs and Features utility.", "Yes. Add English (Barbados) in Windows Settings, Time & language, Language section.", "Yes. but it will require reinstalling the OS in Bajan."], "correctAnswers": [2], "explanation": "It is possible to view apps and websites in many languages and dialects. In Windows Settings, choose Time & language, then Language & region (see the following graphic). Click Add a language to choose the appropriate language to install if it isn’t already installed, then click Next and install to install it and select the desired language as the preferred language. The language may require downloading a language pack. Icons beside the installed language are used to indicate what is available in that language."}, {"id": 26, "question": "A Windows workstation has an application that appears to be locked up, but the keyboard is responsive in other applications. What system tool can you use to terminate the nonresponsive application?", "options": ["Event Viewer", "Task Manager", "Computer Management", "msconfig.exe"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "The Processes tab of Task Manager (taskmgr) will allow you to terminate the non-responsive application. Event Viewer (eventvwr.msc) keeps a log of security, application, and system events. Computer Management (compmgmt.msc) gives access to several other resources, but not one that lets you end wayward applications. The msconfig.exe application launches System Configuration, which gives you access to boot configuration settings, running services, and links to other Windows tools."}, {"id": 27, "question": "Which of the following Control Panel utilities enables configuration of a proxy server?", "options": ["Internet Options", "File Explorer Options", "Device Manager", "Security and Maintenance"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "In the Control Panel, choose Internet Options and select the Connections tab, then LAN. LAN settings will take you to a window that enables configuration of a proxy server. Proxy server settings can also be configured through Windows Settings, by choosing Network & Internet, then Proxy. The File Explorer Options utility is used to configure how files and folders are viewed and how searches are conducted. Device Manager is a great utility to use when troubleshooting hardware issues, and the Security and Maintenance utility provides a quick way to see if security is configured on the PC and any recent messages."}, {"id": 28, "question": "Considering the following graphic, what do you know about the network configuration of this computer? (Choose two.)", "options": ["The PC is configured to obtain an address dynamically.", "This computer is getting its address from a DHCP server.", "The IPv4 address is a routable address.", "The internal network number is 192.168.1.0."], "correctAnswers": [0, 3], "explanation": "The computer is configured to obtain the address dynamically because the graphic says “Yes” next to Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) enabled. If it was set to obtain an address dynamically but not able to reach the DHCP server, the operating system would have obtained an address using Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) and would have been in the range that begins with 169.254.0.0, so this PC is not being assigned an APIPA address. You don’t know for sure that it is getting its address from the DHCP server because someone could have manually configured it to the IP address shown. Addresses in the 192.168.x.x range are non-routable addresses, meaning that they can only be used internally. To reach the Internet, they would go through a gateway (router) that has Network Address Translation (NAT) enabled. (Essentially all modern routers use NAT.) You know the network number is 192.168.1.0 and the host address is 0.0.0.242 by comparing the IP address to the subnet mask. 488     Appendix ▪ Answers to the Review Questions", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 29, "question": "Given the IP address of fe80::308c:fee2:2abc:8337, what do you know about this address? (Choose two.)", "options": ["It is an IPv4 address.", "It is an IPv6 address.", "The subnet mask is 0.", "It is not routable."], "correctAnswers": [1, 3], "explanation": "IPv4 addresses are 32-bits long and consist of four octets, which is a group of eight bits each, separated by a period (.). They are normally presented in dotted decimal notation meaning each group of eight bits is shown as a decimal number less than 256, with a period (.) between each number such as 192.168.1.1. IPv6 addresses are a 128-bit IP address presented as eight segments of four hexadecimal numbers each, separated by a colon (:). Where the hexadecimal number is 0 in any segment, it can be omitted and replaced simply by double colons (::). If consecutive segments are 0, they can all be replaced by a single set of double colons, but only one set of double colons can exist in any given address, otherwise you wouldn’t be able to tell how many sets of 0 are in each part of the IP address. In the example fe80::308c:fee2:dabc:8337, the expanded address would be fe80: 0:0:0:308c:fee2:dabc:8337. The first three segments (48 bits) are the site prefix, and the fourth segment (16 bits) is the subnet ID, also known as private topology or site topology. The site prefix and subnet number together constitute the subnet prefix. The last four segments (64 bits) are the interface ID, also sometimes called a token. The subnet ID in this case would be 0. IPv6 addresses do not have a subnet mask. The value of the first octet, fe80, tells you that this number is a link-local address, an internal number only, not routable.", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 30, "question": "You see an IP address with /48 after it. What does the /48 tell you? (Choose two.)", "options": ["There are 48 PCs on this network.", "The prefix length is 48 bits.", "This network uses the IPv6 addressing scheme.", "This network uses the IPv4 addressing scheme."], "correctAnswers": [1, 2], "explanation": "The IP address in question must be IPv6 because IPv4 addresses are only 32-bits long. The / indicates that the number behind it is the number of bits for the network address in IPv4 or the prefix length in IPv6, both of which identify the network number of an IP address. In IPv4, this is called Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR) notation.", "multiSelect": 2}, {"id": 31, "question": "Which of the following IPv6 address types are routable?", "options": ["Global unicast", "Link-local", "Loopback", "Unique local"], "correctAnswers": [0], "explanation": "Global unicast addresses are routable, like IPv4 public addresses. Meaning that a global unicast address can be reached by any other PC on the Internet, unless you put security measures in place like a firewall. You would likely want a global unicast address on a web server but not on your workstation. Link-local addresses can only be used to communicate with devices that are on the same local link. They will start with fe80 and are assigned in a manner similar to IPv4 APIPA addresses. The IPv6 loopback address is ::1 and is used for testing just like the loopback address in IPv4 (127.0.0.1). A unique local address is akin to an IPv4 private address. Unique local addresses are non-routable, so a computer with only a unique local address and a link-local address (but no global unicast address) would need a router with IPv6 NAT to access the Internet."}, {"id": 32, "question": "You are on a Windows computer that is joined to a workgroup. You’re going home and ready to shut your computer down but want to be certain that no one is using the shared files on the computer first.

A 32-bit system will not be able to take advantage of the full processing power of the 64-bit processor though. Windows 11 requires a 64-bit processor."}, {"id": 34, "question": "A customer has an older PC on which they would like to install Windows 11 Pro. What is the minimum processor speed they must have to install Windows 11?", "options": ["1 GHz, 32-bit", "1 GHz, 64-bit", "2 GHz", "4 GHz"], "correctAnswers": [1], "explanation": "Windows 11 minimum requirements are a 1 GHz or faster 64-bit processor that is on the approved list and has at least two cores, and 4 GB of RAM. Available storage must be at least 64 GB. Firmware must be the newer Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) not the older Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) interface, and it must be Secure Boot capable. The system must support Trusted Platform Module 2.0. Graphics compatible with Direct X 12, Chapter 6: Operating Systems     489 WDDM 2.0 driver and 720p display, and a Home version requires Internet access and a Microsoft account for setup.

What command-line utility can you use to see statistics on network interfaces?", "options": ["ping", "nbtstat", "nslookup", "netstat"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "The netstat command-line utility presents statistics related to the installed network interfaces. By default, on a Windows machine, running the command will display a list of connections and the associated protocol, the source and target address, and the current state of the connection. ping is used to test connectivity between two computers, nbtstat is used for troubleshooting Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) over Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), and nslookup is used to query a Domain Name System (DNS) server."}, {"id": 38, "question": "A new technician asked you how to use a Windows command.

Which one of the following does not work with any commands?", "options": ["help [command name]", "[command name] help", "[command name] /?", "/? [command name]"], "correctAnswers": [3], "explanation": "The /? [command name] syntax simply does not work. The CompTIA A+ objectives list [command name] /?, but there are other ways to get help in the Command Prompt. Typing simply help and pressing Enter at a command prompt will provide a list of commands that help can help you with. Armed with that information, you can type help [command name], for example, help xcopy, and you will see the syntax, switches, and explanations for how the command works.
